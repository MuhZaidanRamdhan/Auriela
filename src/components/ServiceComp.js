                <br /> I hope you are fine there. if you need someone to talk
                to, joke with and other things. Just chat me if you want. no

                can't force you to chat me all the time but if you chat I will
                definitely reply, just tell me what you want to say to me
                personally.

                come to you. I will always be there for you, as a good friend.
